The core application and all plugins with interfaces automatically generate an OpenAPIv3 specification about their own REST endpoints. These generated specifications are put together with the help of the OpenAPI plugin and the complete documentation is provided via a SwaggerUI. The individual REST endpoints are described in detail and can be tried out directly in the UI.
