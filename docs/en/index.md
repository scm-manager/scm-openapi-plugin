This documentation describes the usage of scm-openapi-plugin. It is available in different languages and versions, which can be selected in the menu on the right.

SCM-Manager has a level 3 REST API. This REST API is divided into the core API, which is available for each SCM-Manager instance, and several plugin APIs. Because each instance of SCM-Manager 2 has different endpoints because of the individual configuration and installed plugins, we decided against a central wiki with the documentation of the REST API. Instead each instance generates its own REST documentation.
